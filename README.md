# Autonomous-Food-Delivery-System_EG2310

We developed a Food Delivery system which consists of a Delivery bot and a Dispenser bot. The Delivery bot, 
collects a soda can from the Dispenser bot and then delivers it to the table selected by the user. The system, 
as of now, can deliver to a maximum of 6 different tables. However, the code has been written such that adding
additional tables is easy. The current navigation system is based on stored waypoints.
